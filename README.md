*** Coated Multisphere Scattering Program ***

Welcome! Before you start using this program there are few things you need to know:

1. This program can be completed after going through two stages. This program was created by:
   - (May 2019) Misael Natanael: made multisphere scattering program benchmarked with Mühlig's FDTD [1].
   - (May 2020) Ikhwanul Muslimin: made coated multisphere scattering program based on Misael's program benchmarked with Crut's experiment [2].
   Both are from Department of Physics, Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Bandung Institute of Technology.

2. Make sure the following files are available in the folder:
   - Main program	     : Main_Program.m.
   - Sub-programs	     : A.m, A_.m, At.m, B.m, B_.m, Bt.m, dP.m, P.m, poc.m, and progressbar.m.
   - Refractive index sources: J_C.mat, Johnson.mat, Palik.mat, Si.mat, Weaver.mat, and Matilson.csv.

3. To use this program, please open the main program using MATLAB application. Further instructions will be available in the file.

Thank you for using this program. If you have questions, please contact us via:
